    <h1> My Background </h1>
    <p>
        I was born in London, England in 2003 and lived there for 13 years until moving to San Rafeal, California. I live with both my parents and my little brother along with a tortoise and cat, and have now lived in America for 4 years.

        <h2> Personality </h2>
        I have always been out going and passionate about everything that I do. I always try and be nice to others and try stay positive throughout the day.
        <h2> Interesting Facts</h2>

        <p>
            Some interesting facts about me is that I have travelled to every continent at least twice apart from Soth America and Antartica. I recently went on a road trip from Nebraska (where I have family) to California visiting many national parks along the way.

            <h2>Family</h2>
            <h4>
                <dd>Parents</dd>
            </h4>
            <dt>I'm really close with both of my parents and love travelling and around the world with them.</dt>
            <h4>
                <dd>Little Brother</dd>
            </h4>
            <dt> I'm also very close with my little brother and rarely fight with him. I'm very lucky that we both enjoy similar hobbies such as gaming, running, and soccer.
