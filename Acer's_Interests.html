        Favourite Soccer Team</h2>
    My favourite soccer team is Liverpool Football Club who are currently in Liverpool, England. Our home stadium is called Anfield and I have been there many times to watch the games. Liverpool have a very strong team currently, on a 15 win streak. Our rivals are Manchester United because of a long history and Everton, being the closest team to Liverpool.
